Background / Rationale
************************

Prior to use of RaceDay Scoring, FSRC timing was done as follows

* time machine operation

  * time machine number keypad is used to "select" the bib number for runner
    approaching finish line
  
    * some bib numbers may be missed if people are coming in too quickly
  
  * Enter is pressed when runner crosses finish line to record the time
  * position, bib number, time are printed

* in the finish chute, pull tags are taken off bibs and put on a spindle
* pull tags are taken from the spindle and placed on a sticky board in finish
  order
* the time machine paper output is compared to the pull tags on the board

  * times are written on the pull tags
  * any missed selects should have pull tags on the board, so times can be
    assigned to these pull tags
  * note it's possible the selected number was incorrect but this can be
    corrected at this time
  * if a result entry was missed, the result time can be extrapolated from the
    surrounding results

* the board is visually scanned to determine overall and age group winners
* after the race, the pull tags with are used to create a spreadsheet with the
  results

The goal of using RaceDay Scoring is to provide the ability to automate the
process of identifying award winners and transcribing full results into the
spreadsheet. The time machine is connected wirelessly to a laptop running race
scoring software, but other than that it would be operated as normal. 

RaceDay Scoring runs on the laptop to receive the times and bib numbers. A
volunteer would sit at the laptop and capture the bib numbers for those which
were missed from the time machine, and correct incorrect selects entered in the
time machine.

After the race, RaceDay Scoring has all of the names/times, so there is no need
to copy the names and times into a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be generated
directly from the scoring software. In addition, the award winners are
calculated automatically.
