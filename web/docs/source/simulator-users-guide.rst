User's Guide (Simulator Mode)

:ref:`[Simulation] Results view` describes the controls and indicators used
when running simulations in **tmtility** simulator mode.

The user chooses a simulation to run and sets the start time. The simulation is
controlled using the playback controls to play, pause, stop, speed up, and slow
down the simulation. 

After using the controls to start a simulation, the view operates as described in
:ref:`**tmtility** operation (scanner connected)`

The user can also view previous simulation runs and their results.
