.. _Results view:

Results view
======================
The Results view is used to see the results for a particular Race as they come
in from the Time Machine, and to adjust them as needed. 

    :Place:
        current place of this result after edits, insertions, deletions
    
    :TM Pos:
        position (place) as known by the time machine. This can be compared
        against the paper tape

    :Bib No:
        bib number

    :Time:
        result time

The view has the following controls:

    :Connect / Disconnect:
        the button on the left of the controls is used to connect or disconnect
        from the time machine. If the button says "placeholder" for more than a
        second or two, there's a problem communicating with the reader service
    
    :Race:
        choose the race previously defined at :ref:`Races view`
    
    :Port:
        the COM port which has been set up to communicate with the Time Machine.
        See `Wireless Computer Interface User's Guide
        <https://timemachine.org/tmwci_user_s_guide.pdf>`_ for information on
        how to set up the communication.

To select a row, click on the row. Note when any row is selected, updates to the
display are suspended and a warning is displayed. The row must be deselected by
clicking on it again to resume results display. Edits to Bib No and Time can be
done inline by clicking on the field to be updated. Clicking off the field after
update, or hitting return submits the edit to the database.

Confirmed results have been sent to RaceDay Scoring via the csv file. The
confirmed results are shown in green. To confirm a set of results, click on the
last result to be confirmed (i.e., with the highest *Place* number), then click
the **Confirm** button.
